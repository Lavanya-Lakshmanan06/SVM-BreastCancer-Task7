# Breast Cancer Classification using SVM

This project was completed as part of **Task 7** of my AI & ML Internship at **Elevate Labs**.

## 📌 Objective
To apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms for classifying breast cancer as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 🚀 Tasks Performed
- Loaded and cleaned the breast cancer dataset.
- Trained SVM with both linear and RBF kernels.
- Visualized decision boundaries with 2 features.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Evaluated model performance with 5-fold cross-validation.

## 📊 Results
- Best Accuracy (Cross-Validation): **`XX.XX%`**
- Best Parameters: `{'C': ..., 'gamma': ..., 'kernel': 'rbf'}`

## ✅ Status
Completed ✔️  
Submitted as part of Task 7 at Elevate Labs Internship.
